# Mason's SeattleJS useSound demo

This is a a presentation I put together for a SeattleJS meetup on 3/8/2023.

## Notes:

Just run "npm start" to run the site in development mode, will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

I read from "script.txt" for my talk, most of what I said can be found there.

Links to useSound, Howler, and HTMLAudioElement documentation are in the "Basics" component.
